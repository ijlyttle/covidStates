The purpose of this repository is to show how to use the [projthis](https://ijlyttle.github.io/projthis/) package to manage a project-based workflow. The particular case will be to create a workflow that a daily update of COVID-related graphics.

## Steps 

These are the steps I have taken to get to this point:

1. Created the project using:

   ```r
   projthis::proj_create("path/to/covidStates")
   ```
  
   At this point, a new RStudio IDE opens with the new project.
