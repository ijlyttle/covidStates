title: "projthis demo: COVID-19 cases in US"

The purpose of this repository is to show how to use the [projthis](https://ijlyttle.github.io/projthis/) package to manage a project-based workflow. The particular case will be to create a workflow that, ultimately, automates a daily update of COVID-related graphics.

## Procedure

This directory was created in the [main procedure](../README.md).

1. Edited and knit `README.Rmd`. At this point, the workflow directory is in [this state](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidStates/tree/create-workflow/workflow).

1. With *this* file open in the RStudio IDE, create a new RMarkdown file from a workflow template using:

   ```r
   projthis::proj_workflow_use_rmd("00-import")
   ```

## File structure

```
data/
README.md
README.Rmd
```

- `data/` directory to contain data written by RMarkdown files (empty, not yet committed to git).
- `REAMDE.md` Markdown version of README, viewable on GitHub.
- `README.Rmd` RMarkdown source for REAMDE.
